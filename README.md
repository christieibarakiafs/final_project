## Simple text analysis tool
Current data: sci fi plot overviews from 1960-2018
- Token + Entity extraction and frequency (https://github.com/cibarakiAFS/text_analysis)
- Geocoding + mapping NER locations, visualized in d3 

## Known issues/to-do
- Data: static data set (api call made in java code, user can't change data set)
- Data loading issues... Need to figure out how to efficiently load photos. 
- Add data filters + sort (leftmost column). 
- Map dependencies work on local but not working on github
- Data points on map not connected to obects in middle column
- Should show additional corpus level analysis
- Code needs to be refactored
- ........
